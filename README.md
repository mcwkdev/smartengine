# SmartEngine

SmartEngine is a Python program designed to enhance security protocols by implementing robust authentication and encryption methods for Windows access. The software provides a framework for hashing passwords, encrypting and decrypting data, and generating secure tokens.

## Features

- **Password Hashing**: Utilizes SHA-256 algorithm to securely hash passwords.
- **Data Encryption**: Employs symmetric encryption using the Fernet module from the `cryptography` library.
- **Data Decryption**: Decrypts the encrypted data back to its original form.
- **Secure Token Generation**: Creates secure tokens for session management using Python's `secrets` module.

## Installation

To use SmartEngine, you need Python 3.x and the `cryptography` library installed. You can install the required library using pip:

```sh
pip install cryptography
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use SmartEngine:

```python
from smart_engine import SmartEngine

# Initialize the SmartEngine
engine = SmartEngine()

# Hash a password
password = "YourSecurePassword!"
hashed_password = engine.hash_password(password)

# Encrypt and decrypt data
data = "Some sensitive data"
encrypted_data = engine.encrypt_data(data)
decrypted_data = engine.decrypt_data(encrypted_data)

# Generate a secure token
token = engine.generate_secure_token()
```
